title: Using Google Scholar for Citations
---

In this article I'd like to show you how to use _Google Scholar_ to search for papers and books and get their citations, and I will also show you how to export `BibTeX` formatted text from _Google Scholar_ and save it locally for future references. 

_Google Scholar_[^scholar] is a very convenient tool to search for publications. Here is an example to search the book _Grokking Algorithms_[^grokking]:

![grokking]({{ site.url }}/assets/grokking.png)

As the screenshot shown above, you can see there is a `cite` link under the book search entry. If you click the `cite` link, it will popup a dialog window that show you several different citation styles of text you can use for reference:

![2017-03-06-cite.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/2017-03-06-cite.png)

You can choose one of the style and copy the text directly into your paper or post. From the above screenshot, we can see there are several different formats we can use to export the citation text, such as `BibTeX`, `EndNote`, `RefMan` and `RefWorks`.

You can choose your favorite format and save the citation text locally. For myself, I prefer to save the citation text as `BibTeX` format locally, so I clicked `BibTeX` link, and then I can get the exported `BibTeX` formatted text like this:

![2017-03-06-bibtex.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/2017-03-06-bibtex.png)

I can copy the text and paste it into my local `.bib` file:

![2017-03-06-bibfile.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/2017-03-06-bibfile.png)

Then I can use the tools that can support `.bib` file to manage it for future usage. For example, I can use the popular open-source tool, _BibDesk_, to open and view the citations:

![2017-03-06-bibdesk.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/2017-03-06-bibdesk.png)

By maintaining the local `.bib` file properly, I can use these citations for future usage.

With the help of _Google Scholar_ and _BibDesk_, I didn't use any commercial softwares to fetch and manage these citations.
