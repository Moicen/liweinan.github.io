title: Using Papers And Manuscripts To Add Academic Citations in Github Pages
---

In this article I'd like to share with you how to use _Papers 3_ and _Manuscripts_ under MacOS to do add academic citations in your github pages blog.

Unfortunately, the _Github Pages_ does not support `jekyll-scholar` by default[^https://pages.github.com/versions/], which means you can not use the graceful _BibTex_ support provided by `jekyll-scholar` plugin. This is painful, but this is reality.
