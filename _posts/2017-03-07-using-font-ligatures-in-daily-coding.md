The concept of _Typographic ligature_ is defined like this[^ligature]:

> In writing and typography, a ligature occurs where two or more graphemes or letters are joined as a single glyph. An example is the character Ã¦ as used in English, in which the letters a and e are joined. The common ampersand (&) developed from a ligature in which the handwritten Latin letters e and t (spelling et, from the Latin for "and") were combined.

The benefit of ligatures is the improvement of the readability of the symbols. Here is a comparison of the fonts that supports ligatures versus the ordinary Monospace one[^comparison]:

As the diagram shown above, the ligatures greatly improved the conciseness and readability of the symbols.
