title: Using Java RegExp Engine (03) - Non-Capturing Group
---

Non-capturing group is a concept that supports you to group something in the pattern but don't count it in the result.

Let's see this code example:

```java
Pattern p = Pattern.compile("([a-z])([a-z])([a-z])");
String text = "foo bar";
Matcher matcher = p.matcher(text);

while (matcher.find()) {
    System.out.println(matcher.group(1));
}
```

The pattern is to match three consecutive alphabets, so `foo` and `bar` will match for each `find()`. And group 1 is the first `[a-z]`, so it will match the first alphabet of `foo` and `bar`. The result of above code is:

```
f
b
```

Which is the same like we expected. Now let's modify the pattern a little bit:

```java
Pattern p = Pattern.compile("(?:[a-z])([a-z])([a-z])");
```

Please note we have added `?:` into first group, which means this group is a non-capturing group. The matcher will still match it, but this group will not be counted in the result.

So the `matcher.group(1)` this time will become the second `[a-z]`. Let's rerun the codes and here's the result:

```
o
a
```

Please note the first group, `f` in `foo` and `b` in `bar`, are bypassed. Because the first group has been marked as non-capturing group with `?:`.
