The major advantage of _Cite This For Me_[^citethisforme] is that it can cite multiple types of sources and not limited to journal articles. Here is the screenshot that shows the reference types that the tool supports:

[^citethisforme]: "Save Time And Improve Your Marks With Citethisforme, The No. 1 Citation Tool". 2017. Cite This For Me. [http://www.citethisforme.com/](http://www.citethisforme.com/).

As we can see in above screenshot, the tool can support a lot of types of reference types, this is especially useful when you want to refer to some online medias in academic citation styles.

Though in standard journal papers we can't use some types of online medias as references, but for writing blogs like this one, it's very useful to cite many different kinds of sources in a more standard way.

Now let me demonstrate the usage of the website. Let me try to add generate a citation for this blog site itself. Firstly, I need to click the icon for adding a website like this:

![2017-03-09-cite-add-website.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/2017-03-09-cite-add-website.png)

Then the _Autocite_ dialog will popup, and I could input the URL of this blog site:

![2017-03-09-cite-autocite.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/2017-03-09-cite-autocite.png)

The next step is to click the `autocite` button as shown in above screenshot, and then the basic info of the target website will be automatically fetched:

![2017-03-09-cite-fetch.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/2017-03-09-cite-fetch.png)

The next step is to click the `Final step` button as shown above, and it will redirect to the final edit page:

![2017-03-09-cite-edit.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/2017-03-09-cite-edit.png)

In above page, we can review and modify the info as shown above. After everything is done, we can click the `Add reference` button to add the citation entry:

![2017-03-09-entry.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/2017-03-09-entry.png)

From the screenshot shown above, we have generated a citation entry for this blog site[^weinan], and we can see the citation style is currently `Chicago`. Nevertheless, the _Cite This For Me_ supports a wide range of citation styles, and here is the screenshot of the list:

[^weinan]: "Weinan.Io By Liweinan". 2017. Weinan.Io. [http://weinan.io/](http://weinan.io/).

![2017-03-09-style.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/2017-03-09-style.png)

For example, here is the IEEE style citation:

![2017-03-09-ieee.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/2017-03-09-ieee.png)

After choosing the style we want, we can copy and paste the citation text for our own usages. Finally, you can check the references of this article. It's generated by the _Cite This For Me_ and it's in `Chicago` citation style.
