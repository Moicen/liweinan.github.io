The major advantage of _Cite This For Me_[^citethisforme] is that it can cite multiple types of sources and not limited to journal articles. Here is the screenshot that shows the reference types that the tool supports:

As we can see in above screenshot, the tool can support a lot of types of reference types, this is especially useful when you want to refer to some online medias in academic citation styles.

Though in standard journal papers we can't use some types of online medias as references, but for writing blogs like this one, it's very useful to cite many different kinds of sources in a more standard way.

Now let me demonstrate the usage of the website. Let me try to add generate a citation for this blog site itself. Firstly, I need to click the icon for adding a website like this:

![2017-03-09-cite-add-website.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/2017-03-09-cite-add-website.png)

Then the _Autocite_ dialog will popup, and I could input the URL of this blog site:

![2017-03-09-cite-autocite.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/2017-03-09-cite-autocite.png)

The next step is to click the `autocite` button as shown in above screenshot, and then the basic info of the target website will be automatically fetched:

The next step is to click the `Final step` button as shown above.
